# Bankist App

## Overview
I created this project by following a tutorial in Jonas Schmedtmann's [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I implemented the functionality of the bank by coding the JavaScript. Right now, this project is not mobile responsive.
